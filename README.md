# DroneProject

This repository is a project to help students more intuitively understand geometric vectors through a hands on approach.
A DJI Tello Ryze will be controlled using an android app to visualize simple vectors and the solution to vector related problems like:

- Vector addition/subtraction
- Linear equations
- Linear combinations of vectors
- Vector magnitude

The app will be used in combination with the students' smartphones as well as auxilary worksheets for each of the topics covered.
